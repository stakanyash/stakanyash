### Let's start from the beginning. 
My name is **Nikita** and I create modifications and various projects that are somehow related to the game **Hard Truck Apocalypse** by **Targem Games**. 

Honestly, I have no idea what else I can add about myself here. I also do content making on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@stakanyash). But that's another story.

If you looking for my mods or projects you can find list down below.
