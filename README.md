### Let's start from the beginning.

My name is **Nikita (Russian analogue of the name Nick)**, born and live in Russia and I create modifications and various projects that are somehow related to the game **Ex Machina/Hard Truck Apocalypse** by **Targem Games** since 2022.

Honestly, I have no idea what else I can add about myself here. I also do content making on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@stakanyash). But that's another story. ~~Because it's more sh*tpost than content.~~

If you looking for my mods or projects you can find list down below.
